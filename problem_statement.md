# Problem Statement

Research organizations often rely on highly technical manuals, equipment schematics, and detailed part illustrations to support scientific, engineering, and maintenance workflows. The current process of manually navigating these documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

## Business Challenges
- 📖 **Unstructured Document Overload:** Dozens to hundreds of manuals with mixed content formats (text, images, schematics).
- 🔍 **Lack of Intelligent Search:** No contextual search or conversational interface to interpret user needs or engineering prompts.
- 🧩 **Schematic + Visual Retrieval Gaps:** Illustrations and part-specific drawings are embedded deep in PDFs and not easily retrievable.
- ⚡ **GPU Consumption Concerns:** Continuous LLM inference consumes unnecessary GPU cycles without metadata abstraction.
- 🔒 **Offline Environment:** Strict requirement for air-gapped/local campus-only network deployment, ruling out API/cloud options.
